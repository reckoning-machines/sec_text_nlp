Affiliates of the Corporation and their partners have actively been in discussions with the government on the associated implementation measures which resulted in a signed Heads of Agreement (HoA  -  agreement on principles) on June 25, 2018 and the execution of additional implementation agreements in September. In anticipation of a lower production outlook, the Corporation has reduced its estimate of proved reserves by 0.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels. In addition, the seismic activity has yielded various claims. Where losses are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities have been recorded. The Corporation does not expect these matters to have a material effect on the Corporation's operations or financial condition.
