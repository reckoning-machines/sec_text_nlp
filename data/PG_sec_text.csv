Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Greater China, Turkey and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings.

Because the Company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material net impact to our consolidated operating results in the current quarter. However, the pandemic has had offsetting impacts during the period.  For example, during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 we experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories in certain markets (the health, hygiene and cleaning products, and primarily in North America and Europe) caused in part by changing consumer habits and pantry stocking, contributing to increases in net sales.  At the same time, we experienced declines in Greater China, Japan, and in certain channels, including travel retail, due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements, as well as in certain of our beauty and grooming products.  In the future, the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment.  It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting consumers' movements and access to our products. We believe that over the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits.  However, the timing and extent of demand recovery in markets such as Greater China and Japan, the resumption of international travel, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking in markets including North America and Europe, and product demand trends caused by future economic trends are unclear.  Accordingly, there may be heightened volatility in net sales and resulting earnings during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic.  Our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic.  Their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to, and as a result, sales of our products.",PART I.

If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings.  Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products.  We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.  As discussed later in this MD&A, in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings.

Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.  Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  In four of the past five fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Greater China and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings.  Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits.",PART I.

The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxing rights. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey.

Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products.  We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.

In four of the past five fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, China and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings.

Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products.  We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.

Accounts receivable increased, using $549 million of cash due to sales growth and to a lesser extent, the timing of the quarter-end (which fell on a Sunday, resulting in fewer days collection).  Inventory consumed $601 million of cash primarily due to product initiatives and to support business growth.  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.4 billion of cash primarily driven by an increase in payables to support the increase in inventory, increased marketing accruals based on timing of spending and extended payment terms with our suppliers.

In four of the past five fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, China and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings.

We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures. Our financial results could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, such as the integration of Merck KGaA's Consumer Health business acquired in fiscal 2019, if:  1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets.",PART I,Item 1A.
