The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.

However, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company's control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, commodity prices and prices charged by the industry's material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry's own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services.  As overall industry drilling activity continues to fall in North America, cost pressures for drilling and completion services may ease across the unconventional markets. As the Permian and Marcellus Basins lose momentum overall, the spot markets for services and materials are falling ahead of the cost indices. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, so there may be a lag before the company's results reflect the spot market trends.

In third quarter 2018, differentials generally narrowed outside of North America due to lower exports from key heavy crude producers, low fuel oil inventories and ample low-sulfur (sweet) crude supply.
