Lockheed Martin has taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, work with our customers to minimize potential disruptions and support our community in addressing the challenges posed by this global pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our programs in the expected timeframe, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by the U.S. government, state and local government officials, and international governments to prevent disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The outbreak did not have a material impact on our operating results or business in the first quarter of 2020. However, we are beginning to experience some issues in each of our business areas related to COVID-19, primarily in access to some locations and delays of supplier deliveries.

In addition, other countries have different practices and policies that can affect our international operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. For example, we had a brief pause in operations at the F-35 Final Assembly and Check Out (FACO) facilities in Japan and Italy in March in observance of such countries' COVID-19 policies and additional closures could occur, and we are seeing impacts from base closures and travel restrictions both within and outside the U.S. In many cases facilities are not operating under full staffing as a result of COVID-19, which could have a longer-term impact. Flight test operations and training are being impacted by travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, which could delay our deliveries to customers.

As of March 29, 2020, we had a cash balance of $2.0 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which is also available for borrowings in the event of a lack of short-term commercial paper availability. COVID-19 has also negatively affected the equity capital markets and our returns on our pension assets. As described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, changes in returns on plan assets may affect our plan funding, cash flows and stockholders' equity. Differences between the actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (7.00% as of December 31, 2019) impact the measurement of the following year's Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension expense and pension funding requirements.",PART I.

We are in discussions with the U.S. Government with respect to the timeline for the transition of Turkish sources. While the transition timeline is an important first step, it is equally important that our replacement capacity is re-established so that production is not impacted. Efforts to date have significantly reduced our risk but final resolution on a limited number of remaining components could affect F-35 deliveries, including in 2020, and any accelerated work stoppage would impact cost.

We were not required to test the finite-lived program intangible asset because there were no indicators of a possible impairment. As of the date of our 2019 annual impairment test, we estimated that the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for goodwill by a margin of approximately 40% and the fair value of the intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 10%.",PART I.

Therefore, any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or changes in expected future orders could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections and could cause goodwill and intangible assets to be impaired. Similarly, market factors utilized in the impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates and discount rates could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. As previously disclosed, based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill and indefinitely-lived trademark intangible assets at our Sikorsky business are at risk for impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flows. While we do not currently anticipate any material impairments on our assets as a result of COVID-19, any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or market pressures could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below our current projections and could cause goodwill and intangibles to be impaired.

We have made significant progress toward this end but due to the procedure to qualify new parts and suppliers, this collaborative process between DoD and Lockheed Martin is ongoing.  We are in discussions with the U.S. Government with respect to the timeline for the transition of Turkish sources.  While the transition timeline is an important first step, it is equally important that our replacement capacity is  re-established so that production is not impacted.  Efforts to date have significantly reduced our risk but final resolution on a limited number of remaining components could affect F-35 deliveries, including in 2020, and any accelerated work stoppage would impact cost.  International sales of the F-35 are negotiated between the U.S. Government and international governments and the process to formally remove Turkey from the F-35 program is a government-to-government matter.

At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract.

The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2019 of $6.7 billion  based on an actual rate of approximately 21% improved plan assets more than the $2.3 billion expected return based on our 7.00% long-term rate of return assumption.",PART II,ITEM 7.

A change of plus or minus 25 basis points to the assumed discount rate, with all other assumptions held constant, would result in an incremental increase or decrease of approximately $15 million to the estimated net 2020 FAS/CAS pension benefit. The impact of changes in the discount rate is significantly less than in prior years (i.e., $15 million for 2020 compared to $120 million for 2019) due to the expected completion of the planned freeze of our salaried pension plans that was previously announced on July 1, 2014, which is discussed in further detail below.

The preliminary outlook for 2019 assumes the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our key programs. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2019 net sales, operating margin and cash flows.

The measure would raise spending limits for national defense to $738 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2020 and $740.5 billion in FY 2021. Both totals include Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding which isn't subject to the statutory spending limits established by the BCA. The proposed national security spending in both FY 2020 and 2021 are an increase over the FY 2019 enacted amount of $716 billion, but are lower than the President's budget request of $750 billion in FY 2020 and $746 billion in FY 2021.",PART I.

Additionally, it is possible the U.S. Government will reach the debt ceiling in early September 2019, requiring an increase or suspension of the debt limit in order avoid a potential default on federal payments. As a result, budget uncertainty continues until the budget and debt limit agreement is codified in law. If Congress is unable to reach a timely agreement on full year appropriations for FY 2020, there is a risk of future government shutdowns or funding under a continuing resolution.

Turkey is one of the eight international partners on the F-35 program and has previously committed to purchase up to 100 F-35 aircraft and Turkish suppliers provide component parts for the program, many of which are sole-sourced. International sales of the F-35 are negotiated between the U.S. Government and international governments and Turkey's removal from the F-35 program is a government-to-government matter.

Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors.

Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows.

At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract.

Accordingly, the transaction had no impact on our 2018 FAS pension expense or CAS pension cost, and the difference of approximately $60 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations settled was recognized in other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to FAS pension expense in future periods.",PART II,ITEM 7.

The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods.

If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent",PART II,ITEM 7.

The underlying budget impasse remains, and it is possible that there will be a further partial shutdown or shutdowns. As noted above, while the corporation's largest customer, the DoD, is funded through the end of the government FY 2019 and thus would not be affected by another shutdown, limiting the direct impact of any future shutdown or shutdowns on Lockheed Martin, other customers, such as NASA, are not. In the event of future shutdowns, we may continue to work on unfunded contracts to seek to maintain their projected cost and schedule profiles which, although we would anticipate being paid when the shutdown ends, would put us at risk of nonpayment. Further there may be indirect impacts such as the potential diversion of funds from the DoD and the fact that the Departments of State and Commerce cease to timely process export licenses. While in the recent shutdown there were procedures in place to process on an emergency basis licenses involving direct support to the military, humanitarian aid, or other similar emergencies, there was a growing backlog of non-emergency applications. We anticipate that this will occur again in any future shutdown. While the impact on Lockheed Martin of the recent shutdown was not material, were a future shutdown to occur and continue for an extended period, this might not be the case. In addition, the President has not yet submitted a budget proposal for FY 2020 to Congress. If an annual appropriations bill is not enacted for FY 2020 or beyond, the U.S. Government may operate under a continuing resolution, restricting new contract or program starts and additional government shutdowns, which might involve all government agencies, could arise.
